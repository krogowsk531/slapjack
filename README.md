# SlapJack

**Contributors**

**Project Description**

This was a solo project that was designed to mimic the real life game of SlapJack. Upon window load you see two decks for two players.  You navigate your way through the game based on various different conditions, in order to end up with a player winning by having accumulated all of the cards.  Your game is controlled with keyboard presses that represent dealing a card from a players hand and slapping.  Depending upon what is happening in the game, the banner at the top will adjust to alert the players.  

**Project Goals**

* Create a functioning game with the use of HTML, CSS and JavaScript across multiple classes.
* Write DRY JavaScript and use event delegation for similar event listeners.
* Understand the difference between the DOM and the data model and how the data is displayed on the DOM.
* Use logic to work through many conditionals.
* Use local storage to persist the number of wins when the page refreshes.

**Challenges**

* Mastering the GitHub workflow with many branches and more than one team member.
* We had to add more code than desired in order to make sure that the app did not include bugs.
* Getting the form generated cover to display was the most challenging part of functionality in the project.

**Wins**

* Working with JS in a collaborative environment to a deadline.
* Teamwork that lead to professional development growth.
* All functionality is working through Iteration 5.

**Programming Languages Used**

HTML
CSS
JavaScript

**Other Important Features Implemented**

Saving and removing cover components from arrays respective of functionality.
